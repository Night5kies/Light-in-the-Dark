Hello there!

There is a demo scene located in the folder root. The shields have been placed into the scene for your viewing pleasure.
There is a script on the shields that rotate them based on the mouse screen location; showing off the reflective materials.

Each shield has its own diffuse and normal texture. Located in the Materials folder. 

Shield A - 140 tris   
Shield B - 148 tris

Two prefabs of each asset have been included. One with rigid bodies and colliders on, and one without (Static).

If you wish to lightmap them, remember to turn on 'generate lightmap uvs' in the mesh settings.

Thanks!
